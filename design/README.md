To-Do list

## Description

Our team is going to create a To-Do List web application that helps users organize their tasks efficiently. The app will allow users to add new tasks, update existing ones, delete tasks, and mark them as complete. With an intuitive and user-friendly design, it will cater to anyone looking to boost their productivity and keep track of their daily activities.

Tasks page:
This page will display all tasks: upcoming and completed ones. User can tap on each task to see the whole task information and can delete it from this page.

Task Details Page:
Each task will have a dedicated page showing its title, description, deadline, and priority level. Users can edit or delete tasks from this page.

Task add Form:
A form will be available to create new tasks. Users can enter a title, description, deadline, and set a priority for each task.

REST API:
The backend will include endpoints to create, update, and delete tasks, ensuring a smooth and dynamic user experience.

Database:
Tasks will be stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Railway, with fields for task title, description, deadline, priority, and completion status.
